# Challenger MOD by Lunastellia

This is a mod that adds new roles and a feature to Among Us.

### Guardian

(Team : Crewmate)

# Guardian Settings :

* "Guardian Shield Visibility" = Who can see the guardian's shield, "Target" for only player shielded, "Guardian" for only guardian, "Target+Guardian" for player shielded and Guardian, "Everyone" for all players.


### Engineer

(Team : Crewmate)
The engineer can use the vents just like the impostors and he can also fix one sabotage per game from anywhere thanks to the buttom repair.

### Jester

(Team : Solo)
The jester doesn’t have any tasks. The only way the jester wins is if he gets voted during a meeting by the other players.


### Mercenary

(Team : Crewmate/Impostors)
The mercenary is per default neutral, he doesn’t have any tasks and as the possibility to kill. At the start of the game, he has a cooldown of one minute. Once he kills somebody, he will become impostor and know and will be known by the other impostors. He will also unlock the sabotages and the possibility to vent. Careful, he can also be killed by an impostor or kill one of them ! If the mercenary doesn’t kill anyone he will stay as a crewmate but can still be killed by the sheriff.
