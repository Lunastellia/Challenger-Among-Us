- Engineer (some custom sabotage is currently not repairable)
- Builder (there are problems with some vent)
- Sorcerer (runes do not spawn on the map)
- Arsonist (Refuel station do not spawn on the map, you can play if you choose "0" has the oil value needed to oil a player) 
- Eater The body detection gauge does not work well (due to the floor system)
